These scripts work with a USB switcher board to enable automated testing of an
Android device in host mode. They were written as part of Benjamin Fair's
(benjaminfair@) internship during summer 2016. For more information contact his
host Glenn Kasten (gkasten@).

In order to use the scripts in this directory, you must install some
dependencies. These dependencies vary based on which version of the board you
wish to use. See below for more information.

The scripts require a udev rules file to be installed which is included as
"49-ftdi.rules". Install it to "/etc/udev/rules.d/49-ftdi.rules" then run
"udevadm trigger" as root or reboot. The scripts can also be run as root instead
of installing the rules file.

The following kernel drivers/modules may interfere with access to the ftdi
chip on the board and so may have to be unloaded/blacklisted:
        ftdi_sio
        usbserial

usbswitch.py    Supports initial USB switch prototype with an Adafruit FT232H
                GPIO chip. Requires Adafruit_GPIO library from
                https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO

usbswitch2.py   Supports new single-board switch (red PCB). Only requires
                libftdi1-dev which is in most distributions' repos. Could easily
                be ported to C and statically compiled to eliminate all
                dependencies.

adb.sh          Simple wrapper for adb that handles switching to debug mode and
                back to run mode after executing a command.

full.sh         Example script that shows how to use the switch to run tests
                using the WALT device and app in a fully automated way.
